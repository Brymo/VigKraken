# VigKraken
A key extractor for vignere ciphers

Look let's be honest, nobody uses Vignere anymore but if you happen to go to UNSW and you need to crack one of them in an exam, this one is for you my friend.

Screw dcode.com, this frequency analysis algo is better I swear <3  Link here: https://brymo.github.io/

If you would like to optimise the algo/prettify the site, make a pull request!
